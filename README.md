Project Overview

SuperInsights is a comprehensive data analytics project that explores sales, profit, and shipping trends of a Superstore dataset. This project leverages Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to generate actionable insights and visualizations for retail performance analysis.

The analysis covers:

Total sales and profit across categories and regions

Relationship between sales and profit

Top-performing states and shipping preferences

Profit margin distribution and monthly sales trends

This project is ideal for portfolio demonstration, showcasing skills in data analysis, visualization, and retail analytics.

 Insights & Learnings

Highest sales were observed in [category/region from your analysis].

Profit margins vary significantly by category.

Some states contribute disproportionately to total sales, highlighting regional performance differences.

Shipping mode preferences can inform logistics optimization.

Sales and profit show a moderate positive correlation, indicating proportional growth trends.
